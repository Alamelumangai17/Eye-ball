# Eye-ball

This HTML document creates a simple interactive face with moving eyes that follow the user's mouse cursor. The face consists of a yellow circle with two eyes, and the eyes' black pupils follow the mouse movement.

## Steps to run the project:

step1:Save the HTML file with .html extension.

step2:Click the "Go Live" button.A new browser window will open, displaying EyeBall moving.

## Future Improvements:

1)Add facial expressions or animations to make the interactive face more engaging.

2)Implement user interaction, such as clicking on the eyes to trigger actions or reactions.
Overall, this code creates two eyes that follow the movement of the mouse cursor, creating a fun and interactive "Eye Movement" effect on the webpage.
